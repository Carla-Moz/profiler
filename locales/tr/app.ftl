### Localization for the App UI of Profiler


# Naming convention for l10n IDs: "ComponentName--string-summary".
# This allows us to minimize the risk of conflicting IDs throughout the app.
# Please sort alphabetically by (component name), and
# keep strings in order of appearance.


## The following feature names must be treated as a brand. They cannot be translated.

-firefox-brand-name = Firefox
-firefox-android-brand-name = Android için Firefox
-profiler-brand-name = Firefox Profiler

## AppHeader
## This is used at the top of the homepage and other content pages.


## AppViewRouter
## This is used for displaying errors when loading the application.


## CallNodeContextMenu
## This is used as a context menu for the Call Tree, Flame Graph and Stack Chart
## panels.


## CallTree
## This is the component for Call Tree panel.


## Call tree "badges" (icons) with tooltips
##
## These inlining badges are displayed in the call tree in front of some
## functions for native code (C / C++ / Rust). They're a small "inl" icon with
## a tooltip.


## CallTreeSidebar
## This is the sidebar component that is used in Call Tree and Flame Graph panels.


## CallTreeSidebar timing information
##
## Firefox Profiler stops the execution of the program every 1ms to record the
## stack. Only thing we know for sure is the stack at that point of time when
## the stack is taken. We try to estimate the time spent in each function and
## translate it to a duration. That's why we use the "traced" word here.
## There is actually no difference between "Traced running time" and "Running
## time" in the context of the profiler. We use "Traced" to emphasize that this
## is an estimation where we have more space in the UI.
##
## "Self time" is the time spent in the function itself, excluding the time spent
## in the functions it called. "Running time" is the time spent in the function
## itself, including the time spent in the functions it called.

## consumption. The carbon dioxide equivalent represents the equivalent amount
## of CO₂ to achieve the same level of global warming potential.


## TrackBandwidth
## This is used to show how much data was transfered over time.
## For the strings in this group, the carbon dioxide equivalent is estimated
